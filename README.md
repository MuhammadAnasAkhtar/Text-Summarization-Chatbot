# Text-Summarization-Chatbot

# Overview
This project is a Text Summarization Application that helps users condense large pieces of text into concise summaries. Built using state-of-the-art machine learning models, it provides a simple and user-friendly interface to generate summaries with adjustable lengths.

# Features
AI-Powered Summarization: Utilizes the BART model from Hugging Face, fine-tuned specifically for text summarization tasks.
Customizable Summary Length: Users can adjust the summary length approximately by selecting the desired word count.
Interactive Interface: Designed with Gradio for an easy-to-use and intuitive web-based experience.
Public Access: Generate a public link for the application, making it accessible to anyone.
# How It Works
Input Text: Users provide the text they want summarized through the application interface.
Adjust Length: A slider allows users to define the approximate length of the summary.
Generate Summary: The application processes the input text and returns a summarized version based on the selected length.
# Benefits
Saves time by condensing lengthy texts into shorter, meaningful summaries.
Customizable output length caters to various user needs.
Suitable for research, content creation, and quick reading.
# System Requirements
Python environment with necessary libraries installed.
Internet connection to access the pre-trained model.
# Limitations
Summarization accuracy may vary with highly complex or technical text.
The word count estimation is approximate and might not always align perfectly with the desired output length.
Processing speed may depend on the computational resources available.
# Future Enhancements
Support for multiple languages.
Ability to summarize web pages or PDF documents.
Improved control over summarization style and tone.
